# Portfolio React

This is a Vite + React conversion of the original static portfolio.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd c:\myportfolio\portfolio-react
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL.

Notes:
- Uses Tailwind CDN for styling to avoid build-time setup.
- Copies original pages into React components and React Router.
